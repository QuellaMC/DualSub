# RCOS Proposal

**Version 2 -- Fall 2025**
**Date: 2025/9/15**
**Project: DualSub**

---

## Overview

Our DualSub project was initially designed to revolutionize the user's video streaming and language learning experience by providing real-time, dual-language subtitles on major platforms like Disney+ and Netflix. We have successfully built a stable Chrome extension that achieves this core functionality, allowing users to seamlessly integrate language learning into their entertainment time.

With the core features now well-established, we plan to upgrade DualSub from a subtitle tool into a more comprehensive and intelligent language learning companion. In this new phase, we will introduce more interactive and personalized learning features, such as a vocabulary saving function and intelligent contextual explanations. Concurrently, we will continue to expand our support to more streaming platforms and further optimize the user experience, aiming to make DualSub an indispensable language learning assistant for video streaming.
